# Cost-Benefit Analysis of Electric vs Diesel Vehicles

## **Project Overview**
This project performs a comparative cost-benefit analysis of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Diesel Vehicles, focusing on aspects like initial cost, operational efficiency, ROI, and environmental impact. The goal is to provide actionable insights for stakeholders considering vehicle adoption.

---

## **Objective**
- Compare EVs and Diesel vehicles in terms of:
  - Purchase cost
  - Running & maintenance costs
  - Return on Investment (ROI)
  - Environmental impact (emissions)
- Generate visual insights and recommendations using data-driven methods.

---

## **Dataset**
- Data collected from company records, industry reports, and publicly available datasets.
- Stored in the `data/raw/` folder.
- Cleaned and processed datasets are stored in `data/processed/`.

**Sample files include:**
- `Book1.xlsx` – Vehicle cost data  
- `Propel Cost Analysis.xlsx` – Operational costs  
- `ROI MEV.xlsx` – ROI calculations  
- `equ.xlsx` – Supporting calculations
